This "jobs" folder holds
https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/index.html[Jenkins Job Builder]
YAML files, which define jenkins' jobs.

One can declare a single job per file or create a job-template to declare several jobs of the same kind.
The gerrit-verifications.yaml file for example holds all gerrit verification jobs.

'''
*WIP:* Furthermore, we're planning to automatically deploy merged changes by having two jobs based on gerrit events:

pre-merge:

- test generation of XML

post-merge:

- test generation of XML
- deploy jobs

'''
The XML test generation is done by:

 jenkins-jobs test jobs/


The deployment will be done by:

 jenkins-jobs --conf "$JJB_CONFIGFILE" update jobs/

but it is not clear *yet* how we want to store/inject the `"$JJB_CONFIGFILE"` part.
