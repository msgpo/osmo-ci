# Poky Installation

The poky installation requires you to have the installer available.
Put the `poky_installer_file` to the root directory of this repo.
Also the exact filename must match the variable `poky_installer_file` and the
`poky_version`.
For the defaults of those variable have a look into `defaults/main.yml`.
